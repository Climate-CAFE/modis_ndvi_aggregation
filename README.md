# Query of 16-day MODIS Aqua Data and Aggregation of Summertime NDVI
Download MODIS Aqua NDVI data from NASA EarthData and aggregate to summertime average. 

## Project Overview
Using the luna R package, greenness measures are downloaded from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using the Aqua satellite. Summertime (warm season) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) averages are calculated using 16-day estimates at roughly 250m resolution. Suffolk County, Massachusetts is used as a demonstration area for the NASA Earth Data query and spatial aggregation.
