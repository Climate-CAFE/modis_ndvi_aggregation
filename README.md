# [Tutorial in progress] Query of 16-day MODIS Aqua Data and Aggregation of Summertime NDVI 
Download MODIS Aqua NDVI data from NASA EarthData and aggregate to summertime average. 

## Project Overview
Using the luna R package, greenness measures are downloaded from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Aqua satellite. We calculate summertime (warm-season) averages of two vegetation indices: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) using 16-day MODIS composites. These composites provide vegetation index estimates at approximately 250‑meter spatial resolution. Suffolk County, Massachusetts is used as a demonstration area for the NASA Earth Data query, data processing, and spatial aggregation.
